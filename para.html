An AI Health Assistant is a smart digital tool designed to help people manage their health more effectively. It can answer medical queries, track daily activities, monitor symptoms, and provide reminders for medicines or appointments. By analyzing health data, the assistant can give personalized suggestions to improve lifestyle and well-being. While it cannot replace doctors, it acts as a supportive guide, making healthcare more accessible, faster, and easier for everyone.
